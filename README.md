## Overview

RAGOps Studio is a conceptual enterprise platform for designing, operating, and monitoring large-scale RAG systems.  
It focuses on the *operational layer* of RAG: evaluation, observability, data freshness, and reliability — not just retrieval.

This project showcases how a modern RAG operations platform could look and feel for ML and platform teams.
